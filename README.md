# Politecnico di Milano - CHAOS Challenge dataset - Organ Segmentation Project

This repository contains the project work of a student from Politectnico di Milano who was assigned the organ segmentation task with the CHAOS Challenge dataset for his Biomedical Computer Vision course. This dataset is a valuable resource for studying computer vision techniques and image segmentation in the context of medical imaging. It offers a set of Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences from different patients with liver, kidneys, and spleen annotations.

## About the Dataset

The Combined (CT-MR) Healthy Abdominal Organ Segmentation (CHAOS) Challenge Dataset is a collection of CT and MR images for healthy organ (liver, kidneys, and spleen) segmentation tasks. It was sourced from 80 routine abdominal screening procedures conducted at the Dokuz Eylul University Hospital (Izmir,Turkey), with scan images stored in DICOM format and corresponding annotations as PNG files.

## Goals

The main objectives for this project include:

- Conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the structure, content, and characteristics of the dataset.

- Apply various computer vision techniques and algorithms to pre-process the CT and MR images within the dataset. (resampling, denoising, histogram equalization, sharpening, thresholding)

- Build and evaluate various Deep Learning models for liver segmentation on CT images.

- Build and evaluate various Deep Learning models for liver, kidneys, and spleen segmentation on MR images.
